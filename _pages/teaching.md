## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in making mathematics accessible and relevant by connecting abstract concepts to real-world applications. My approach emphasizes:

- **Active Learning**: Encouraging students to engage with problems through discussion and collaboration
- **Computational Thinking**: Integrating programming and numerical methods to solve mathematical problems
- **Real-World Applications**: Using examples from environmental science, engineering, and data science
- **Individual Support**: Providing personalized guidance to help each student succeed

## Professional Development

**Teaching Workshops Attended:**
- "Effective Teaching Strategies in STEM" - Boise State University (2023)
- "Using Technology in Mathematics Education" - MAA Workshop (2022)
- "Inclusive Teaching Practices" - Graduate College Workshop (2022)
