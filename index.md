Iâ€™m a highly motivated Ph.D. candidate in Computational Mathematics with a strong background scientific computing, numerical modeling, data assimilation and inverse methods. My research focuses on modeling complex physical systems particularly wildfire smoke transport by combining high-performance computing with techniques from data assimilation and inverse problems. I enjoy building and testing algorithms, running large-scale simulations, and working across disciplines to solve real-world challenges. Sharing my work through writing and presentations has also been a key part of my growth as a researcher.
